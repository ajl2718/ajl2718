## Hello 👋

I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer who applies maths and stats to problems in healthcare. I work mainly in Python and R with occasional forays into SQL via DuckDB.

### 🔭 Some interests
- Applying NLP models (various incarnations of BERT, LLMs and simple rule-based algorithms) to messy, unstructured clinical data
- Data linkage and geocoding using DuckDB
- Risk prediction models for earlier detection of cancer
- Developing tools that assist data scientists work more efficiently, whether it is for data labelling or exploring large linked datasets

### 🔧 Technologies
- Python • R • SQL
- ML frameworks: PyTorch,  Hugging Face
- LLM tools: Langsmith
- Cloud and ML deployment: Databricks, Pyspark, Azure, RunPod
- Dev: VS Code, uv, GitHub, Quarto

### 🌱 I'm currently learning
- Language models (Sebastian Raschka's book on LLMs)
- Stats (Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking)
  
### ⛰️ Other activities
- Exploring mountains and hiking trails in various parts of the world
- Books and documentaries
- Riding my bike
- Cooking experiments
